Students in colleges sometimes can miss non-academic activities while studying . Our projects SAFE involves the non-academic needs of a college students like:

1. Stores for buying old items of seniors.
2, Activities for checking club activities going in college.
3. Feed for checking feed of college.
4. Election for election purpose of college.


Our main motive is to bring all the co-curricular activities of the together and fulfill the common need of college students.

## What it does

Our project is a web-based application aimed at helping the college students community in a unique way. For students searching for any old used book/item or checking club activities around the campus or voting for college elections is where our web application SAFE comes to play.

This way, the app not only creates a sense of community but also increases the co-curricular activities along with fulfilling common needs of college students.

Users can create accounts, upload their own profile and check feed about college along with activities about college going around in the clubs. Furthermore if a student needs something from a senior like book/cycle, he/she can buy it second hand on the store section. User can also vote for their elections for coordinators.
